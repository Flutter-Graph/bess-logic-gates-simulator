slots of same type cannot be connected togather i.e. input slot can't be connected with input slot and same for output slot.

--- SIMULATION ---

slot<changed> -> (parent).simulate [calculate the final state depending on its input state and set its output slot to that value] ->
	[then change the value of each connected slot to that state and continue this cycle]
